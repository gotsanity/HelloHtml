    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p><b>Marinade:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp Oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Ground Pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Pineapple Juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup White Vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Achiote paste</li>
        <li>2 Canned Chipotle Peppers (in adobo sauce)</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Tacos:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs Pork Tenderloin</li>
        <li>1-2 Rings Canned Pineapple</li>
        <li>1/4 Small Red Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the marinade: Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Remove to a food processor and process until smooth. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Remove the silverskin and any visible fat from the pork tenderloin. Butterfly the pork, but slicing from end to end, almost, but not all the way through. Open up and press flat. Place into a plastic bag. Pour cooled marinade into bag and rub to coat the meat. Seal bag and refrigerate 8-24 hours.</li>
        <li>Before cooking meat, prepare salsa by combining all ingredients in a bowl. Stir to combine, cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Regardless of how you are cooking, the pineapple and onion will not take as long to cook as the pork, so simply remove when done and continue cooking the pork until cooked through.</li>
        <li>To cook on BBQ: Grill pork, pineapple rings and onion quarter until pork is cooked through and pineapple and onion are nicely grilled.</li>
        <li>To cook in grill pan on stove top: Cook pork, pineapple rings and onion quarter over medium-high heat until cooked through and/or grilled.</li>
        <li>To cook in the oven: Place pork, pineapple rings and onion quarter on a foil-lined baking sheet under the oven broiler, about 6-8 inches from the heat. Cook until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove pork, pineapple rings and onion to a cutting board. Allow pork to rest a few minutes, then, using a sharp knife, cut the pork, pineapple and onion into small slices and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>To serve: Heat or grill tortillas. Spoon in some of the pork/pineapple/onion mixture. Top with salsa. Serve with lime wedges, for drizzling.</li>
    </ol>
